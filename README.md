# What I learned

This project got me familiar with using Bootstrap and using css at a higher level. Bootstrap boilerplates are a fantastic resouce to help build out the basic elements of a webpage while saving you time by not having to create them on your own. Once I got comfortable with the Bootstrap classes, I was able to tweak things here and there and make a layout that fit my desired theme.

Creating a responsive webpage for the first time proved challenging. Through the use of Bootstrap's "fluid" classes and custom media queries in CSS, I was able to create a mobile-friendly webpage. My biggest challenge here was keeping images and containers lined up, while trying not to over-complicate by adding too much CSS on top of Bootstrap's native classes. The browser inspector tool proved critically important!

I look forward to the future when I have the tools to impliment more back-end features so I can get this page fully-functional!
